The chance for cyclic items to spawn in dungeon chests is now in config as ChestLootChance and defaults to 4 (it used to be hardcoded as 7; still can be disabled by ChestLoot config as normal).  Removed Emerald Shovel and Axe from dungeon loot.  All Ender Projectiles now work out of a dispenser (Snow, Bombs, Blaze, Dungeon Finder, Fishing, Lightning, Torch, Water, Shears).

Slime conveyors: now take up full space of the block (like a carpet) instead of partial (like a pressure plate) so entities dont have inconsistent speed at edges of a block.  Slime conveyors now keep the entity 'grounded' so they dont get sudden bursts of speed when going down a block onto a conveyor on a lower level(as seen in xisumavoids video with the sheep. can be reverted to old behavior in config->SlimeConveyorKeepEntityGrounded).

Reduce Packager lag by only searching for a new recipe when the inventory contents changes.   Reduce Auto Crafter lag by only searching for a new recipe when the inventory contents changes.

Each quadrant of Ender Library can store 999999 enchantments, up from 64.  Ender Library now saves its data when picked up and placed down as an item, for safe transport like a shulker box. Fixed Model Variant Exceptions showing in log file.  Fixed water candle sometimes spawning mobs in the ground or creating other duplicate blocks.  All dynamyte now uses ExplosionEvent.Start event to allow other mods to hook and cancel explosions if needed.  Piston Scepter: removed rotate mode (wooden wrench does exactly this); Piston scepter now pushes a whole line of blocks not just one, matching real piston behavior; also it checks canPlayerMove for permission hooks.  Ender Library now checks for enchanted books of stack size != 1 for mod compatibility.  Improve Storage Bag button tooltips for useability.  Storage Bag deposit updated to use capabilities (more compatible with more modded inventories for example AA Crates).  Added crystallized_amber and crystallized_obsidian to default BlacklistInput config for the uncrafter (not affecting existing modpacks but reccomended to add these values).  Updated how Forester looks for ore dictionary logWood blocks when logs have metadata (fixes Biomes o Plenty trees in forester).  Forester now skips air blocks faster.  Password Trigger now works if player is in a different dimension than the block (if blocks chunk is loaded by something).  Added configs to tweak the x/y offsets of the inventory buttons.

By popuplar demand, renamed 'Whitelist/Blacklist' to 'Allowlist/Ignorelist' in a few tooltips (functionality unchanged).  Added some error safeguards in case IE wires throw an exception when hit by a certain projectile.  Block the extraction of items from the Workbench using things like hoppers (fixes some exploits).  Fixed Auto User in attack mode not hitting the full area in larger sized selections.  "
	,"1.20.4":"Add config to reverse placement of machines -UnInvertedPlacement- (default value is no changes, edit to make machines face away from player on placing).  Confirmed compatibility with Guide-API-2.1.8-63 "
	,"1.20.5":"Optimize BaseEnchant calls to EnchantmentHelper and HashMap (merge PR Ricket).  Fix merchant almanac bug.  Fixed Cyclic Fluid Node Transfer Rate does not change with GUI.  Fix compatibility crash with Just a Few Fish mod.  Fix a pattern replicator block server crash bug.  Missing texture added for potion effect 'stunned'.  New config SprinklerAnimationsAllowed.  Experience pylon fill and drain logic overhauled to fix bugs; player can sneak on the pylon to drain into it.  If a player currently has the cyclic bounce potion effect bounching, and is using Multi-jump enchant as well, the horizontal momentum given from the multi-jump click is greatly reduced to avoid combining with the bounce enchant and becoming overkill.  "
	,"1.20.6":"Auto crafter now correctly moves container items to output slots and refills them (such as full buckets in cake recipe).  Boomerang fixed to not break certain strong blocks such as Reinforced glass from securitycraft when thrown.  Also Boomerang by default will no longer break blocks when flying (config boomerang.doesBreakBlocks to restore old way).  (trunksbomb) Fix Pattern Replicator to not cause out of bounds exception  "
	,"1.20.7":"If a block has its fuelcost config set to zero, it now will also hide the energy display in GUI screen, and block capability connections.  New config added for energy cost to run machine I:peat_farm=64 [range: 0 ~ 500000, default: 64] in cyclicmagic.cfg file (prevously was hardcoded 64 default).  "
	,"1.20.8":"Fixed crash introduced in 1.20.7 energy cable"
	,"1.20.9":"Fix crash in peat farm GUIs when config has I:peat_farm=0.  Fix unchant pylon leaving an empty NBT tag when all enchantments are removed (this allows unenchanted items to go through uncrafting grinder and other compatibility things).  Fix Structure Builder offset directions in CV - Circle Vertical setting.  Fix typo in Diamond and Iron spikes config.  Fix stat.killEntity.robot compatibility error. Fix Random and Pattern gui settings of the Range building scepter.  Fix Peat-fired Generator Gui energy bar not rendering bug.  "
	,"1.20.10":"PR merged from embeddedt: Prevent milk bucket from removing flight when player is in creative mode.
